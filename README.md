## Ionic + JHipster ðŸ’¥

This repository consists of an example Ionic application that works with JHipster's backend. The only thing that's currently working is JWT authentication. 

**This repo served as an early prototype of what is now [Ionic for JHipster](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/generator-jhipster-ionic). Ionic for JHipster module includes support for entity generation, JWT or OIDC authentication, and testing support.**

To run this example, complete the following steps, run the JHipster backend first.

```
cd jhipster-jwt-backend
./mvnw
```

Then run the Ionic frontend in another terminal window:

```
cd ionic-jhipster-example
npm install -g ionic cordova
npm install
ionic serve
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8100>, login with `admin/admin` and explore!

## TODO

There is no entity generator integration at this point, but if you click on "Entities", you'll see what my vision is.
